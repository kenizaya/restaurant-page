# restaurant-page

In this project I was supposed to write all the HTML to the DOM only via javascript.
I was allowed to have one div id=content, in template.
Using webpack was a hassle in the start, but I understand it's worth.


Tech Used:

HTML

CSS

Javascript

Webpack

NPM


Lessons Learn't:
Too much time consuming to use only JS to manipulate DOM without writing HTML
